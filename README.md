# Reactjs Practice - *Youtube API*

**Youtube API** is an app that I write to learn reactjs with redux.

Time spent: **4.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following functionality is completed:

- [x] User can search for particular clip on youtube.
- [x] The search functionality doesn't kick in immediately, but a wait for a while to eleminate the laggy experience when user keeps typing in the search bar.
- [x] User can see a particular youtube clip inside of the ap.
- [x] User will see a list of default clips 
- [x] Reponsive design with boostrap

## Notes

May add redux later to manage state better...
